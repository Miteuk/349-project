My name is Timothy Kue and this is my portfolio for 349 Web Development.

How To Run my Portfolio

-Open the folder on Visual Studio Code
-Right click the "Index.HTML" file and click "Open with Live Server".
-If you do not have Live Server, you can download it from the Extension tab. Just search "Live Server."
-The portfolio should be open and now feel free to browse through. The menus for different pages are at the top of the page.
