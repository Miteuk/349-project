            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-text">
                <p>Hi, I’m Timothy Kue, a 28-year-old computer science major from Orange County, California. I’m Hmong, and my heritage is an important part of who I am. Growing up with a strong sense of cultural pride, I’ve always valued the traditions and values that come with being part of the Hmong community. This cultural background has shaped my perspective and inspired my curiosity to explore and create, whether in technology or in life.</p>
                <p>From a young age, I’ve had a fascination with technology and creativity, which has led me to pursue hobbies like building custom mechanical keyboards, playing competitive pickleball, and developing video games. These hobbies not only provide me with an outlet for my creativity but also allow me to connect with others who share similar passions. I enjoy being part of communities where I can learn, share, and collaborate.</p>
                <p>Traveling is another passion of mine. So far, I’ve been fortunate to explore Japan, Korea, and Australia—experiences that have not only broadened my worldview but also reinforced the importance of understanding different cultures. Traveling has deepened my appreciation for diversity, which I believe is essential for both personal growth and professional development.</p>
                <p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I am deeply involved in music. I play piano for my church’s worship team, which allows me to blend my love for music with my faith. Playing in a group setting has taught me the value of collaboration, discipline, and using my talents to contribute to something greater than myself.</p>
                <p>I’m currently working towards my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, where I am continuing to build a strong foundation in programming languages like C++, C, and C#, with additional experience in Java, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. My academic focus is on game development, software engineering, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence. I am passionate about applying the knowledge I’ve gained in the classroom to real-world projects that can make a meaningful impact.</p>
                <p>As I continue on my journey, I strive to stay curious, creative, and open-minded—always seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. Whether through my work in tech, my involvement in music, or my connection to my Hmong roots, I’m committed to living a life that reflects my diverse passions and values.</p>
